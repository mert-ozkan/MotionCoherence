# Psyc161FinalProject
## Basic EEG Analyses and Data Visualisation Using a Previously Collected EEG Data

My main purpose in the course to learn better data visualisation methods. So, in this project I want to work on an EEG project of which data I finished collecting myself last year. I ran statistical analyses, even found significant effects which I hypothesised but all ended up not writing the paper. As part of this course I want to learn a software to preprocess EEG data (I only need to do some final steps in preprocessing since the data is already preprocessed in BrainVision Analyzer) and visualise EEG data in multiple ways. I want to use MNE software unless you have a better suggestion. I normally benefit from software/toolboxes/packages to a certain degree. So, I imagine -especially during plotting- I will be appealing to other python packages. In the end of this project I want to have publishable figures. My tentative plan is as follows:

1.  Going over the introduction and data structures documentations <https://martinos.org/mne/stable/documentation.html#>
2.  Starting with the pre-processing data (I will only need to implement a few final steps here)
3.  Drawing ERPs (My design has 3x6 conditions. So it won't be very simple I guess)
4.  Visualising changes in ERP components' amplitude and latency (Possibly using pandas, numpy, altair and seaborne)
5.  Wavelet Analyses
